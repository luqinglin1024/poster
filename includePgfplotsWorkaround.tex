% include pgfplots and do a workaround to add the missing layers. This problem might be related to pgfplots and tikz versions as pointed out in: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/104010/why-does-loading-pgfplots-after-tikz-break-the-default-layers-in-a-tikzpicture

\usepackage{pgfplots}

% define layers
    \pgfdeclarelayer{foreground}
    \pgfdeclarelayer{background}
    \pgfdeclarelayer{backgroundlayer} 
    \pgfdeclarelayer{notelayer}
% tell TikZ how to stack them (back to front)
    \pgfsetlayers{background,backgroundlayer,main,notelayer,foreground}
